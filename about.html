      <h2>Meet the Creator</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Hi! My name is Jason, and I’m currently studying web development with a strong interest in front-end design, user experience, and digital storytelling. I enjoy building projects that blend creativity and code, and this website is part of my final project for CIS 181: Web Development I.</p>
        <p>I chose to design this site around Paris not only because of its global appeal, but also because I had the chance to visit this past summer. That experience left a lasting impression on me — the architecture, the culture, the food — and gave me a rich source of inspiration for showcasing the city’s charm through a visual medium like the web.</p>
